## Duckett Reading: HTML and CSS

#### Introduction

One thing interesting from this reading, the realization that servers where one requests access to a site are all over the world. Very interesting how connected our is through technology, and very fast too!

#### Structure Chapter 1

We read through this chapter in 102, but here is a brief summary. This chapter covers what HTML can do with bringing the structure and organization to a webpage. The HTML provides the text and separates a webpage in multiple sections using tags. Always make sure to declare your doctype at the beginning and enclose everything you want on the page into the html tags. Main sections include the title tag, this is where you put information about your page. The head tag, which is everything you want at the beginning of the page along with other information including you link to you css and js files. Tags are referred to as elements these usually come with an opening and closing tag. Elements can have attributes like a lang or src attribute and they will have a value meaning a particular file or image you want displayed. 

#### Extra Markup Chapter 8 

This chapter was covered in 102. [Read04 from code102](read04.md) Use comments within your code to help create an outline, leave reminders, or notes for others sharing your code. There are a few attributes that are used often. First is the id attribute. Use this to give an element a unique identification to differentiate from other elements. Using an id attribute is very important with CSS since you can use styles that will only impact this unique element. The class attribute is a step above where you can group multiple elements together and use this class attibute value in CSS to impact only those with this class identification. Block element will naturally start on a new line, separte from another. Common block elements are h1, p, ul, and li. Inline elements continue in the same line as other elements. This include a, b, em, and img. The **div tag**, or element, gives you the ability to group multiple elements together into a single block level box. The span element is the inline version of the div element. You can use it to help differentiate text if you have no other options available or you have multiple inline elements to contain. iFrames are a website within a website. A small box, like google maps, will bring a link into another page. You use your src, height, and width attributes to help give an exact url and how large you want the iFrame to appear. You will also use your scrolling, frameborder, and seamless attributes to further adjust. The meta element is used to contain data about the webpage and it is located within the head tag. A few values that you would use with the meta element are description, keywords, robots, author, pragma (prohibts a browser from being able to cache a page.), and expires. Review your escape characters on page 194. You use these to include things like a copyright symbol, dollar sign, Trademark, etc. 

#### HTML5 Layout Chapter 17

Use headers and footers to start and end your page. Nav elements for for your primary navigation through the website. Article elements are used as conatiners to include content that can be separated on it's own. The aside element is used in two different ways. Inside the article element is contains info that is related to the article. Outside the article element it serves as a container containing content that is related to the whole page. The section element can help group togehter content such as news, topics, brands, menu items, etc. The hgroup element is used to group headings, h1 through h6, together and are treated as a single heading. The figure and figcaption element acts as a container for content in the article. You would use this for diagrams, images, games, graphs, and code examples.The a, or anchor, tag helps you to reference a link. You have to use the href attribute when sighting a url or other page. 

#### Process and Design Chapter 18

Read this chapter in 102. [Read04 from code102](read04.md). To summarize this chapter, there is a series of questions you must ask yourself when building a website. 
Who are you targeting? Certain occupations? Countries? Age group? Use of web? Likes and dislikes? Education level? etc.
Are you targeting any specifice companies?
What are your motivations and goals for producing this website?
What do you want your visitors to achieve on your site?
What information will your visitors need from you? From them?
How often are visitors going to visit your website? Someone may visit a site like Amazon more frequently then say United Airlines.
A site map can help you gain a visual of how you want your website navigation to flow. Make sure you are clear, concise, and not overwhelming your visitor with information. Wireframes are also great for showing how each page will be formatted. A good item to show clients. 
How can you keep people coming back? What makes your site better than another similar site(s)?

Prioritizing certain content using visual hierarchy can help to convey your message clearly. Where do you want the visitor's eyes to go first? An image is one of the best items to use for this. A large image can draw the eyes easily. Maybe a large heading will work too or creating a style that stands out. How you organize will really help to not overwhelm a visitor. How do you want your page to flow? Hierarchy on the top? Right? Left? Grouping items together can help show a visitor that these items are alike. Keeping items close together, wrapped with a border, or a connected flow shows they are related. Having items in separate shaped boxes or white space can help create a divide in the items signaling to the viewer that they are different. Make sure the nav bar is not overloaded with too many extra links. Have a few topics, organize them, and be clear with is in each tab. Be sure to show some sort of indicator showing the viewer what page they are on. 

#### Javascript Introduction Chapter 1

This was covered in code 102. 
[Read06a from code102](read06a.md) 

As I stated in my notes for code 102:
> Javascript is our third layer in a webpage where we can change the behaviour of the page, adding interactivity. Javascript enhances the user experience of the website and/or the experience of interacting with the website.
