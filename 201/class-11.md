    Above will turn an image into a block level element.

    For a background image:

            body {
                background-image: url("enter url here");
            }

### The background-repeat allows you to have four values:

repeat - exactly what it does, repeats horizontally and vertically.

repeat-x - horizontal only

repeat-y - vertical only

no-repeat

fixed - a fixed position on page

scroll - the image scrolls

Use the background-position and add value of left top, left center, left bottom, center top, center center, center bottom, right top, right center, and right bottom. Use % to adjust as well.

**Shorthand background**

        main {
            background: blue url("enter here") no-repeat top left;
        }
        
Specify properties in order below:
background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position

Rollover - Three different changes to image, standard, when the user hovers over it, and when the user clicks. 

Sprite -  image used for multiple parts of interface. 

CSS3 gradients - for a gradient, you have to specify the two colors that the gradient should set between. you need to use the background-image property and use your -webkit and -moz. See code example on **page 419**.

Contrast background images - If you want your text to appear over an image, generally you will want low contrast applied to your image.

Use a large element (html, body) to apply general properties and give is an id or class of **wrapper**.

Keywords are huge for this.

Having links to and from other sites also improves visibility. 

Seven places where keyeword are located on the page to help users find you.

1. Page Title
2. URL
3. Heading
4. Text
5. Link Text
6. Image alt Text
7. Page description

Make sure your keywords appear in these places, but don't over use the words. The **meta** tag is where you can place information about your page, including keywords. 

Identifying keywords and phrases

1. Brainstorm - come up with a list
2. Organize - categorize them
3. Research - use tools to get suggestions
4. Compare - look at other sites and how they land in a search
5. Refine - choose certain keywords that might work best. If there is one that is very relevant to your page but many others are using, still use it.
6. Map - Choose 3-5 words for each page of your site.

Use analytics to understand how users found you. This can show you things like how many visitors, how they found you, how long they stayed, how many pages they visited, etc. Bounce rate shows you people that left the same page they enetered. This may suggest they were not interested.
