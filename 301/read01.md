# React

- Immutability - this makes it easier on us. An object or value that is immutable can't be changed. Each updates creates a new value and leaves the old one alone. 

- props - properties. Use props when passing state from parent component to child.

- Function components - simpler way to write a component. Only contains render method and doesn't need it's own state. Can take in props and returns what is to be rendered. 

- concat() - not like the array push(). This method does not change the original array.

- map() - it's use is to map data to other data coming in from arrays. We can use this to map our history.

- key - Term only in React. Takes in list items and re-renders by searching for keys. If the new/ current list has a new key, React creates a component. If the key is not found on the new list from the previous list, that component is detroyed. If our keys match, component is moved. If changed, the component is destroyed and re-created with a new state.
