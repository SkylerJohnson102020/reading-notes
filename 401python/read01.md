# Pain and Suffering 

1. Whatâ€™s your perspective? 

- I have developed over years of a brutal career with many sacrifices and the challenges that Code Fellows has presented, I just tell myself that being in a terrible and frustrating position is just par for the course. One of my music teachers told me something I carry with me to this day, "Embrace the suck."

2. Why are you doing this?

- My career pays very little and I had to piece together multiple positions that all paid in the four figures. I drove 25,000 - 30,000 miles a year for work and always scraped the bottom of the barrel every summer when musicians are out of work. Then, the 2020 pandemic shut down our extrememly fragile industry. My wife and I had a son and I decided that I couldn't take it anymore. I wanted to find something new where I could better myself, and my psyche, but also the lives of my family members. I couldn't just find anything, I needed to find something that enabled me to continue to problem solve, be challenged, and be creative. This is why I am here.

3. Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?

- I want it all, the pain, challenge, waiting, etc., I'll be ready. 

4. Are you doing this for you?

- I am doing this for me and especially my family.
