# In Tests We Trust - TD with Python

- Unit tests - code that tests the input, output, and behaviour of the code.

- TDD - Test Driven Development

- Be extremely descriptive about your test/function name. The one here in the article is 11 words long. This helps to tell us exactly what we are getting in return.

- test file name needs to be the same as the module name.

        ex:
            skyler.py
            test_skyler.py

- Separate the test code from the dev code.

- AAA - Arrange, Act, Assert

- Arrange - organize the data, or your input, necessary to execute your code.

- Act - test the behaviour. executing code.

- Assert - check results.

- TDD: **The Cycle**: in three steps - 
    
    1. Write a test that fails.
    2. Write code that makes it pass.
    3. Refactor

- Using TDD makes us think about design and breaking it up into smaller pieces.

- In TDD, craft the design of the software first.
- Through TDD, code is more reliable.
