https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python

Random functions allows access to many functions, operations, and, most importantly, generates random numbers. Common uses are for when a randomized goal is needed.

random.randint() - 2 params- lowest and highest num. and gives a random number in the range given.

random.random() - multiply - it would look like random.random() * number here

random.choice() - random selection from a sequenece like a list. It can be a list of different values, just pass in the data structure to select random choice.

random.shuffle() - shuffles a list in random order

random.randrange() - random selected element from given range. Params taken (start, stop, step)

# What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?

Risk analysis is a good practice since it identifies any potential problems that might be encountered during production. Having a test plan is key in this process.

Risks that might be encountered:
From the article:

> 1. Use of new hardware
> 2. Use of new technology
> 3. Use of new automation tool
> 4. The sequence of code
> 5. Availability of test resources for the application

Unavoidable risks:
From the article: 

> 1. The time that you allocated for testing
> 2. A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application
> 3. Urgency from the clients to deliver the project
> 4. Incomplete requirements
