# Docker

> "A baking analogy we can use here is as follows:
> 1. A Dockerfile is the recipe for a cake
> 2. An image is a snapshot of the recipe at a given time
> 3. A docker-compose.yml says how to make the cake
> 4. And the container is the actual, baked cake."

> "The important takeaways from this tutorial are this:
> 1. Docker is a way to run Linux containers
> 2. Containers are a lightweight alternative to Virtual Machines
> 3. `Dockerfile` is a list of instructions for creating an image
> 4. Images are made up of one or more layers
> 5. Containers are a running instance of an image
> 6. `docker-compose.yml` controls how to run the container
> 7. Containers are stateless and ephemeral in nature. We can link the local filesystem via volumes but things become more complex with databases (which we didnâ€™t cover here)."
