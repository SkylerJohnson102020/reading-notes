# Ethics in Tech

### The code I'm still ashamed of

I never thought about holding true to moral standards when thinking about tech in the workplace. I can only imagine the deep regret Bill must feel, and still feels. I think asking enough questions to know exactly what you're getting into and knowing when to walk away and find another job is paramount when in situations like this. In a situation like this, it may have been best to say something to save lives. Bottom line, best to know what you're what exactly you are doing before doing it.

### The cybersecurity risk of self-driving cars

Very interesting read. I think there are some things in tech where we can't put computers fully in control. Yes, the technology will get better, but so will the hackers. This seems like a big risk to rely fully on the computer to operate a car. There are so many dangerous possibilities that can happen even without the security risks like glitches, bugs, lighting storms, other weather, etc. You just don't know what can happen until it does. This seems like a really cool idea, but just too dangerous in my mind.
