> 1. "Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices."
> 2. "Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
> 3. "Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge."
> 4. "Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
> 5. "An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction."
> 6. "A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next."
> 7. "A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
> 8. "A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge."
