> "Nowadays, when many tech companies receive a CV from a prospective developer, they usually skim over the sheets of paper and spend more time investigating the applicantâ€™s Github account."

The above quote has me thinking a lot about what is important to a prospective employer. There are many more aspects involved than just "Hey, can you code?" Can you work with others? Are you able to listen and accept feedback? Are you an active developer? etc. 

I never thought about OSS until reading these articles. It's very nice that a developer can contribute to the very same tools that they like to use. Perhaps that it shows that you care, you are active, and maybe most importantly, you enjoy and care about development.
