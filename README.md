# Learning About Markdown

## What I have learned so far.
Learning a new language is not easy, it takes time. To my musician colleagues out there, learning a new computer language such Markdow is just like learning how to read music; it isn't a spoken language, but more of one you read and translate. You can do a lot with this language to build your own website. For example, I can make headings using the # symbol. I can use anywhere from one # for my largest heading like the one and the top of this page, or I can use six # to show my smallest heading like the one below.

###### The smallest heading size using six #.

### My three # size headline plus a list below using asterisks for each item on each line.
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

I can also make word **bold** or _italicized_ using two asterisks on either side of the text I would like to make bold at one underscore on each side of the text I would like italicized. **_I can even combine them both!_**

I can use a quote simply by putting my text on this line.
> Then on the line below, start this line with a > and your tex will look like so!

#### I can even drop in links using [ ] for text and ( ) for the url.
[This is my link to a Backpacker Page](https://www.backcountry.com)

I can use tables as well to help convey my thoughts in a more constructive manner.
First Category | Second Category
-------------- | ---------------
Info from column 1 | Info from column 2
Row 2 Column 1 | Row 2 Column 2

Combine them! I can make a code tag suggestion in a quote and use some bold text!
> You **should** probably use the <p> tag for this!
