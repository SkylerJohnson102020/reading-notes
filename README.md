# Learning About Markdown

## What I have learned so far.
Learning a new language is not easy, it takes time. To my musician colleagues out there, learning a new computer language such Markdow is just like learning how to read music; it isn't a spoken language, but more of one you read and translate. You can do a lot with this language to build your own website. For example, I can make headings using the # symbol. I can use anywhere from one # for my largest heading like the one and the top of this page, or I can use six # to show my smallest heading like the one below.
###### The smallest heading size

### My middle sized headlines plus a list below using asterisks.
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

I can also make word **bold** or _italicized_ using two asterisks on either side of the text I would like to make bold at one underscore on each side of the text I would like italicized. **_I can even combine them both_**!
```python
def hello_world:
```
