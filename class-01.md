## Duckett Reading: HTML and CSS

#### Introduction

One thing interesting from this reading, the realization that servers where one requests access to a site are all over the world. Very interesting how connected our is through technology, and very fast too!

#### Structure Chapter 1

We read through this chapter in 102, but here is a brief summary. This chapter covers what HTML can do with bringing the structure and organization to a webpage. The HTML provides the text and separates a webpage in multiple sections using tags. Always make sure to declare your doctype at the beginning and enclose everything you want on the page into the html tags. Main sections include the title tag, this is where you put information about your page. The head tag, which is everything you want at the beginning of the page along with other information including you link to you css and js files. Tags are referred to as elements these usually come with an opening and closing tag. Elements can have attributes like a lang or src attribute and they will have a value meaning a particular file or image you want displayed. 

#### Extra Markup Chapter 8

This chapter was covered in 102. Use comments within your code to help create an outline, leave reminders, or notes for others sharing your code. There are a few attributes that are used often. First is the id attribute. Use this to give an element a unique identification to differentiate from other elements. Using an id attribute is very important with CSS since you can use styles that will only impact this unique element. The class attribute is a step above where you can group multiple elements together and use this class attibute value in CSS to impact only those with this class identification. Block element will naturally start on a new line, separte from another. Common block elements are h1, p, ul, and li. Inline elements continue in the same line as other elements. This include a, b, em, and img. The div tag, or element, gives you the ability to group multiple elements together into a single block level box. The span element is the inline version of the div element. You can use it to help differentiate text if you have no other options available or you have multiple inline elements to contain. iFrames are a website within a website. A small box, like google maps, will bring a link into another page. You use your src, height, and width attributes to help give an exact url and how large you want the iFrame to appear. You will also use your scrolling, frameborder, and seamless attributes to further adjust. The meta element is used to contain data about the webpage and it is located within the head tag. A few values that you would use with the meta element are description, keywords, robots, author, pragma (prohibts a browser from being able to cache a page.), and expires. Review your escape characters on page 194. You use these to include things like a copyright symbol, dollar sign, Trademark, etc.
