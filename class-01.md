#### Structure Chapter 1

We read through this chapter in 102, but here is a brief summary. This chapter covers what HTML can do with bringing the structure and organization to a webpage. The HTML provides the text and separates a webpage in multiple sections using tags. Always make sure to declare your doctype at the beginning and enclose everything you want on the page into the html tags. Main sections include the title tag, this is where you put information about your page. The head tag, which is everything you want at the beginning of the page along with other information including you link to you css and js files. Tags are referred to as elements these usually come with an opening and closing tag. Elements can have attributes like a lang or src attribute and they will have a value meaning a particular file or image you want displayed.
