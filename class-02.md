- Headings. h1 being the largest, h6 being the smallest.

             <h1> through <h6>

- Paragraphs

                    <p>

- Bold text. Surround a word or section of text that you would like to embolden.

        <p>
        I would like the last word of this sentence to be <b>bold.</b>
        </p>

- Italic text. Surround a word or section of text that you would like to italicize. 

        <p>
        I would like the last word of this sentence to be <i>italicized.</i>
        </p>

- Superscript. The superscript (sup) element's use is for containing characters like suffixes dates and/or math concepts. Like the rd in 3rd or 3 to the n power. Text slightly above the line.

- Subscript. The subscript (sub) element's use is to contain characters like periodic table element. Text slightly below the line. 

        <p>This 3<sup>rd</sup> of July we will have no rain, or H<sub>2</sub>0, in the forecast.
        </p>

        This 3rd of July we will have no rain, or H20, in the forecast.

- White space. There will naturally be white space in between each element. This is line spacing. White space collapsing is if you have too much space in your code but the content is contained in the opening and closing tag, it will still be rendered onto the webpage properly. Also, having separate p tags will trigger a line break. 

        <p>I don't really like white        space anyway!</p>
        <p>I don't      really like white space       anyway!</p>

        I don't really like white space anyway!
        I don't really like white space anyway.

- Line Breaks. Use this tag to cause text following the tag to drop to the next line. 

        <p>I don't <br /> like line breaks <br /> at all!</p>

        I don't
        like line breaks
        at all!

- Horizontal Rule. You can use this to break text that have a separate theme or topic.

        <p>Summer is for backpacking!</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Winter is for skiing!</p>

        Summer is for backpacking!
        --------------------------
        Winter is for skiing!
