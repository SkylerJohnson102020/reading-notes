# Understanding the Problem Domain

The problem domain refers to any and all information that defines a problem to which the solution is part of that problem. Like trying to throw darts in the dark, you may not know where to throw and it could be dangerous where the dart lands. The best way to tackle a problem is to break it down into small piece to tackle first gather than easily getting overwhelemed by everything you have to do. 

An Agile project is one where you work in a team tackling task that you are assigned. Now you can still struggle to know what to do since your piece of the pie could still be overwheleming. Best to try to break it aprat and try to understand as much of your problem as possible before starting. Better to do it right the first time than do it all over again.
