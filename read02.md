Choosing a Text Editor
From reading The Old Coder's article, I learned that the use of a particular text editor is a very personal thing. Each of the editors can operate on anywhere from many systems to one. The individual may find specific editors with extensions within them that provide the best working environment for that particular individual. Although there is no right or wrong text editor choice (please correct me if I am wrong), but it all boils down to what little nuances in the particular editor work best for you. For example, I have a high sensitivity to light and can get migraines from this, so for me, a dark screen with color identifying text will work best for me. There are also some other languages like Emmet that have piqued my interest. In any case, I will be looking for whatever I need in order to make my coding go as smoothly as possible.

You maybe be thinking, what the heck is a text editor? Well, it is exactly that. These are programs that you can download online and you can use these programs to help build a website. Code completion, syntax, and spacing are all very important when working with a text editor. Typos can really crush your website. If you don't enter something just right or properly close it, the function will not work. Fortunately there are some text editors with extensions that will catch any typos you may have in your code. It does this by highlighting the problem so you can find it quickly. A nuance like this can help you move faster and more efficiently.

An example of this might be that you need to make sure to close your tags. If I have a paragraph, so <> with a p in between, text after, then the closing tag, <> with /p in between, this should work properly in html. If I am missing a < or > or the letter in the tag, this will not function properly. So, it is nice to have an extension that will catch this for you. There are plenty if other extensions in these editor that can really help avoid complications. Choosing the right text editor is up to you, so my suggestion is to try a couple and see which one you like.

cd - change directory
pwd - print worker directory
ls - list all visable files
ls -a - lists all files, including those that are hidden.
ls /etc - lists the directory's contents.
~ - A shortcut for your home directory (Example: ~/Documents)
. - This references your current directory. (Example: ./Documents)
.. - This is a reference to the parent directory. (if you are in the path /home/skyler, you can use ls ../../ for example to do a listing of the parent directory.)
Use the Tab completion to use auto complete. If nothing comes up, then this means there are multiple possibilities. Hit Tab again and it will show you the options.
/etc - stores config files for the system
/var/log - stores log files for various system programs.
/bin - The location of several commonly used programs
mv - move
cp - copy
