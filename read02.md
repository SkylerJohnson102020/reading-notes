## Choosing a Text Editor
From reading The Old Coder's article, I learned that the use of a particular text editor is a very personal thing. Each and every program operate anywhere from many systems to one. The individual may find specific programs or extensions within those programs that provide the best working environment for that particular individual. Although there is no right or wrong text editor choice (please correct me if I am wrong), but it all boils down to what little nuances in the particular editor work best for you. For example, I have a high sensitivity to light and can get migraines from this, so for me, a dark screen with color identifying text will work best for me. There are also some other languages like Emmet that have piqued my interest. I will be looking for whatever I need in order to make my coding go as smoothly as possible.
