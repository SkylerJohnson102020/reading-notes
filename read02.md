## Choosing a Text Editor
From reading The Old Coder's article, I learned that the use of a particular text editor is a very personal thing. Each and every program operate anywhere from many systems to one. The individual may find specific programs or extensions within those programs that provide the best working environment for that particular individual. Although there is no right or wrong text editor choice (please correct me if I am wrong), but it all boils down to what little nuances in the particular editor work best for you. For example, I have a high sensitivity to light and can get migraines from this, so for me, a dark screen with color identifying text will work best for me. There are also some other languages like Emmet that have piqued my interest. I will be looking for whatever I need in order to make my coding go as smoothly as possible.

## Terminal Cheat Sheet
- cd - change directory
- pwd - print worker directory
- ls - list all visable files
- ls -a - lists all files, including those that are hidden.
- ls /etc - lists the directory's contents.
- ~ - A shortcut for your home directory (Example: ~/Documents)
- . - This references your current directory. (Example: ./Documents)
- .. - This is a reference to the parent directory. (if you are in the path /home/skyler, you can use ls ../../ for example to do a listing of the parent directory.)
- Use the Tab completion to use auto complete. If nothing comes up, then this means there are multiple possibilities. Hit Tab again and it will show you the options.
- /etc - stores config files for the system
- /var/log - stores log files for various system programs.
- /bin - The location of several commonly used programs
- mv - move
- cp - copy
