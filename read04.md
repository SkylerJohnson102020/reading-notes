## Who is your site for?
#### Ask Yourself:
- Age range of my target audience
- Average income of visitors
- What part of the country do they live? A different country?
- How often are they on the internet?
- Occupations?
- Level of education of visitors
- Hours of work per week
- What device are they using to access your site?

#### For target companies
- What is the size of the company?
- Position of people within the company who visit the site?
- How large of a budget does this company carry?

#### Why people visit my site?
There are **two basic categories** to keep in mind
1. What is the motivation behind an individual visiting my site?
2. What are the goals of these visitors when visiting the site?

Html stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. Html is the structure of a website. Stictly using html is not very pretty to look at as it is only the structure. All you will see is mainly text and perhaps some photos. CSS is how we stylize our website, but we will get into that later. Html is comprised of a lot of tags. These tags contain an opening and closing tags, attributes, and you include contents as well.

There are many tags that you can use and there are many different types of tags. There are many different types of basic tags, formatting tags, form and input, images, links, frames, lists, tables, and the list goes on from there. First things first, you have to start your file with a DOCTYPE command, and certainly select html.

## Here are a few basic tags
    <h1><h2> - heading or titles
    <title> - use for the title of the page in the tab
    <html> - open and close your document with this 
    <head> - is a container placed between html tags
    <body> - defines the body of the document
    <header> -  define the header of a section
    <nav> - navigation, intended for major block of links
    <img> - image <img src="url here">
    <p> - used for paragraphs, text
    <link> - connect an external link
