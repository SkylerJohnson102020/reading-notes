# Read 04 Notes HTML

## Who is your site for?
#### Ask Yourself:
- Age range of my target audience
- Average income of visitors
- What part of the country do they live? A different country?
- How often are they on the internet?
- Occupations?
- Level of education of visitors
- Hours of work per week
- What device are they using to access your site?

#### For target companies
- What is the size of the company?
- Position of people within the company who visit the site?
- How large of a budget does this company carry?

#### Why people visit my site?
There are **two basic categories** to keep in mind
1. What is the motivation behind an individual visiting my site?
2. What are the goals of these visitors when visiting the site?

#### What information do my visitors want to see?
- Are they familiar with your brand or do you need to explain yourself?
- Will they know your product or do you need to give an explanation?
- What are the most important features of what you're selling?
- What makes you different from others who offer something similar?
- Are there FAQs about your site from visitors?

Some sites need more updates then others depending on what they're about. Something like a sports website like Bleacher Report will have to update more frequently since many new events happen everyday. A roofing company won't need to update as frequently. One needs to determine how often to update in order to keep people visiting.

## What do I do now?
- Create a site map 
    - A site map is a diagram of the all the pages you are using to       strucutre you site.

- Card Sorting
    - Card sorting is a technique to help you decide what goes where. Essentially creating a map of where everthing is categorically.

- Wireframing
    -This is drawing of how each page should appear. This can even be drawn on a piece of paper. This will help give you a better idea of how each page will look. Consider it like a blueprint. 

- Organization 
    - You will have a lot of information, make sure you think clearly about how you want to organize all of this info in a way to where it appears clear and readable. You can group content blocks together to help accomplish this.

- Distinction
    - Make other parts more distict to either draw attention to or from something.

- Visual Hierarchy
    - Where do you want to visitior to look first when visiting a page? Where does the visitor's attention go first? This refers to the order in which a vistior's eyes see the site. It what order are your items seen? Make sure you use size, color, and style to accomplish this.
        - Size, specifically larger items. Larger items like large text or heading can grab attention.
        - Color - Either foreground and background color can draw attention to something you're wanting to highlight. Brighter sections tend to draw visitors in first.
        - Style - A specific item may blend too well into the page and maybe needs to need more style. An example of this is playing around with fonts when you want something to stand out. 
    
    - Images are huge when it comes to Visual Hierarchy. These often catch the viewer's attention first. 

- Balance - 

Html stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. Html is the structure of a website. Stictly using html is not very pretty to look at as it is only the structure. All you will see is mainly text and perhaps some photos. CSS is how we stylize our website, but we will get into that later. Html is comprised of a lot of tags. These tags contain an opening and closing tags, attributes, and you include contents as well.

There are many tags that you can use and there are many different types of tags. There are many different types of basic tags, formatting tags, form and input, images, links, frames, lists, tables, and the list goes on from there. First things first, you have to start your file with a DOCTYPE command, and certainly select html.

## Here are a few basic tags
    <h1><h2> - heading or titles
    <title> - use for the title of the page in the tab
    <html> - open and close your document with this 
    <head> - is a container placed between html tags
    <body> - defines the body of the document
    <header> -  define the header of a section
    <nav> - navigation, intended for major block of links
    <img> - image <img src="url here">
    <p> - used for paragraphs, text
    <link> - connect an external link

These are just a few tips on how to get started with HTML
