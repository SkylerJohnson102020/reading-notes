# Read 04 Notes HTML

Html stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. Html is the structure of a website. Stictly using html is not very pretty to look at as it is only the structure. All you will see is mainly text and perhaps some photos. CSS is how we stylize our website, but we will get into that later. Html is comprised of a lot of tags. These tags contain an opening and closing tags, attributes, and you include contents as well.

There are many tags that you can use and there are many different types of tags. There are many different types of basic tags, formatting tags, form and input, images, links, frames, lists, tables, and the list goes on from there. First things first, you have to start your file with a DOCTYPE command, and certainly select html.

## Here are a few basic tags
    <h1><h2> - heading or titles
    <title> - use for the title of the page in the tab
    <html> - open and close your document with this 
    <head> - is a container placed between html tags
    <body> - defines the body of the document
    <header> -  define the header of a section
    <nav> - navigation, intended for major block of links
    <img> - image <img src="url here">
    <p> - used for paragraphs, text
    <link> - connect an external link
