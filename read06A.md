# Javascript

Javascript is our third layer in a webpage where we can change the behaviour of the page, adding interactivity. Javascript enhances the user experience of the website and/or the experience of interacting with the website.

There are a few parts to a line of javascript code.

            document.write('Good Afternoon!');

- The first part of the code is the object. All browsers implement this object and you can use it simply by giving it's name here.
- An object can have many properties and methods, these are called members of that object. The dot, or member operator, helps us to access the members of the object named. You use the dot to access the members of a dot. 
- Method - the write() method of the indicated object, in this case document, gives us the ability the write new content to be written to our page where we have placed our script element. Make sure you open and close with the script element.
- Parameters - Our method may need some extra information or content in order for the method to work properly. We place this information in () just after the method. This piece of information can be more easily referred to as the parameter of the method. The js file needs to know what to write on the page. In the example above, the () contains 'Good Afternoon". 
**THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY PORTIONS OF OUR CODE, OBJECT AND METHOD.**

## JS and HTML

- When our browser comes upon a script element in the HTML code, it will stop on that script to load it and will also determine if it needs to do anything.
- We can place our script element anywhere we want in our html code. 
- The script element is set of instruction instructing that a particular computer will be able to follow in order one at a time. A single instruction is a **statement**. All statements should end with a ;.
