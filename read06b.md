# How Computers Work

## What makes a computer work

#### There are 4 main tasks a computer needs to take

1. Take Input
2. Store information
3. Process the information
4. Then output the results

These are common to all computers.

Computers started off as basic calculators.

### Input

- What the user tells the computer to do. Whether that is a mouse click, recording your voice, tracking your heartbeat, bluetooth connections in car, phone sensing your finger on the screen, etc.-

### Storaging and Processing

- All of the inputs give the computer different information which is then stored in it's memory.
- A computer then takes it from storage and processes or changes it using an algorithm, or a series of commands.
- This processed information is then sent back into storage and this process is continued until it's ready for Output.

### Output

- Output can be used to control apps, games, texts, virtual reality, etc. The neat thing is that output from one computer can then be input for another and also the other way around.

## Data and Binary

- Computers work on 0 and 1, or binary system. No one really pays attention to this anymore, but it plays a huge role in how a computer works.

- Computers use electricity through a wire. What does that mean? It means this signal can either be on or off. 0 if off, 1 is on. This is also like true or false and yes or no.

- This on/off state of a wire is called a **bit**. A bit is the smallest piece of information a computer can store. More wires equals more bits!

### The Binary Number System

- In the decimal system, we have number 0-9. In Binary, we only have 0 and 1. 

- **The decimal system** goes 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and so on. 

- **The binary system** multiplies itself, so 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.

For example: The number 9 in binary is 1001. The first 1 is in or 8 spot. Is there an 8 in 9? Yes, subtract it from 9 and the remainder is 1. The first 0 is in our 4 spot, is there a 4 in 1? No, put a zero. The next 0 is in our 2 spot, is there a 2 in 1? No, put a zero. The final 1 is in our 1 spot. Is there a 1 in 1, well of course. So, 1001.

### Images in Binary

- Images are represented by pixels, which are colors. You can use numbers (RGB) to control these pixels. Photos are made up of millions of pixels

### Sound

- A series of vibrations. These can be represented in waveform. More bits will allow more wave form.

## Circuits and Logic

- In order to process the info that come in as input, and to make the info that is output, a computer needs to modify and combine the output signals.

- To do this, a computer uses millions of small elements called **circuits**. 

- A circuit can take multiple different signals. Ex. Two signals coming in and one output. If either input is 0, then result is also 0. If both inputs are 1, then our result is a 1. This circuit is called **And**.

- A simple circuit takes a signal and flips to opposite. The signal going in is not the same as going out. So, This is called a **Not**. 

- An **Adder** circuit takes in 2 bits, either a 0 or a 1, and adds them together to calculate it's sum. 

- The smaller the circuit, the less distance the electcity has to travel, so therefore the computer is faster.

## CPU, Memory, Input & Output

- CPU is the **Central Processing Unit** where all information is calculated and processed.
