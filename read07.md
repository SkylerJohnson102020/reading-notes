# Programming with JS

Examples of JS rely on the abilty to 

- **Access** content of a page
- **Modify** content of page
_ **Program** steps for a computer brower to take
- **React** to to event from the user implements in the browser.

1. **Define the Goal**

2. **Design the Script**

3. **Code Each Step**

**Functions**
pg 88 definition

**Calling the Function**

- This is when you ask the function to perform it's designated task.

**Parameters** 

- These are individual pieces of information the function needs in order to complete a task. Some functions require more than one piece of information, or parameter, to complete the task. The parameter inside a function behave like variable names.

**Return Value**

- When you expect the function to give you an answer.

#### A function holds a value, or information, and is only used when you are ready. Functions gather and hold information, then you have to **CALL** the function on the last line of the script. This will allow you to use the data the function gathered.

        function sayHello() {
            document.write('Hello');
        }

**In the example above:**

1. The function is "declared" by typing in the function keyword. 
2. You then give the function a name, or identifier. In this case, sayHello()
3. The curly brackets contain your statement. This will perform your task.
4. Using the function name in your code is how you are able to call the function.

### The steps of calling a function.
pg 91 diagram
1. The function stores the steps of a task.
2. When you require the script to execute your task, you then call the function.
3. The function will then perform the code written inside the curly brackets and put it on the website.
4. When it completes the task, the code will continue to run from where you called it.

**Sometimes your functions can seemingly be out of order and they might not work. (Example, you want the userName before the userName was declared.) This doesn't matter if the functions are all in the same script since the computer will run through the entire script before executing the statements.**

### Arguments
